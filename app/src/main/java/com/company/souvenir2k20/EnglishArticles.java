            "For quite some time now, the lure of rural India has been the subject of animated discussion in corporate suites. And there is a good reason too. With urban markets getting saturated for several categories of consumer goods and with rising rural incomes, marketing executives are fanning out and discovering the strengths of the large rural markets as they try to enlarge their markets. Today, the idea has grown out of its infancy and dominates discussions in any corporate boardroom strategy session. Adi Godrej, chairman of the Godrej group that is in a range of businesses from real estate and personal care to agri-foods, has no hesitation proclaiming, It is a myth that rural consumers are not brand and quality conscious.\n" +
                    " A survey by the National Council for Applied Economic Research(NCAER), India's premier economic research entity, recently confirmed that rise in rural incomes is keeping pace with urban incomes. From 55 to 58 per cent of the average urban income in 1994-95, the average rural income has gone up to 63 to 64 per cent by 2001-02 and touched almost 66 per cent in 2004-05.

                    "million in 2001-02. It will have a 22 to 23 per cent rural component. Higher rural incomes have meant larger markets. Already, the rural tilt is beginning to show. A study by the Chennai-based Francis Kanoi Marketing Planning Services says that the rural market for FMCG is worth $14.4 billion, far ahead of the market for tractors and agri-inputs which is estimated at $10 billion. Rural India also accounts for sales of $1.7 billion for cars, scooters and bikes and over one billion dollars of durables.\n" +
                    "In total, that represents a market worth a whopping $27 billion. It is no wonder that even MNCs have cottoned on to the idea of a resurgent rural India waiting to happen. Four years ago, Coke ventured into the hinterland. Now Coke's rural growth of 37 per cent far outstrips its urban growth of 24 per cent. Coke is not the first MNC to have cottoned on to the rural lure. Its global rival Pepsico took a wider approach to the business when it was given permission to set up shop in India in the late 1980s and investment in food processing and farming was a pre-condition for entry. The company imported a state-of-the art tomato processing plant from Italy to Punjab.\n" +
                    "In five  years, productivity improved from 16 tonnes to 52 tonnes per hectare and there was a tomato glut in the state. Farmers weren't complaining becauseeven though prices fell, their incomes increased because of the huge jump in productivity. Rural India accounts for a market worth $27 billion.

                    "2.1 BY COMMUNICATING AND CHANGING QUALITY PERCEPTION\n" +
                    "Companies are coming up with new technology and they are properly communicating it to the customer. There is a trade-off between Quality a customer perceives and a company wants to communicate. Thus, this positioning of technology is very crucial. The perception of the Indian about the desired product is changing. Now they know the difference between the products and the utilities derived out of it. As a rural Indian customer always wanted value for money with the changed perception, one can notice difference in current market scenario.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "2.2 BY PROPER COMMUNICATION IN INDIAN LANGUAGE\n" +
                    "The companies have realized the importance of proper communication in local language for promoting their products. They have started selling the concept of quality with proper communication. Their main focus is to change the Indian customer outlook about quality. With their promotion, rural customer started asking for value for money.\n" +

Villagers are constantly looking forward for new branded products. What can one infer from these incidents, is the paradigm changing and customer no longer price sensitive? Indian customer was never price sensitive, but they want value for money. They are ready to pay premium for the product if the product is offering some extra utility for the premium.\n" +

                    "Companies have recognized that social and cultural values have a very strong hold on the people. Cultural values play major role in deciding what to buy. Moreover, rural people are emotional and sensitive. Thus, to promote their brands, they are exploiting social and cultural values.\n" +

However, if the seller provide frills free of cost they are happy with that. They are happy with such a high technology that can fulfill their need. As \"Motorola\" has launched, seven models of Cellular Phones of high technology but none took off. On the other hand, \"Nokia\" has launched a simple product, which has captured the market.\n" +

If he/she can visualize himself/herself with the product, he /she becomes loyal to it. That is why companies like Daewoo based their advertisements on a normal Indian family.\n" +

MNCs have found that it is much easier for them to operate in India if they acquire an Established Indian Brand. Electrolux has acquired two Indian brands Kelvinator and Allwyn this has gave them the well-established distribution channel. As well as trust of people, as people believe these brands. Similarly Coke has acquired Thumps up, Gold Spot, Citra and Limca so that they can kill these brands, but later on they realized that to survive in the market and to compete with their competitor they have to rejuvenate these brands.\n" +

                    "Media Rural marketing is being used by companies. They can either go for the traditional media or the modern media. The traditional media include melas, puppetry, folk theatre etc. while the modern media includes TV, radio, e-chaupal. LIC uses puppets to educate rural masses about its insurance policies. Govt of India uses puppetry in its campaigns to press ahead social issues. Brook Bond Lipton India ltd used magicians effectively for launch of Kadak Chap Tea in Etawah district. In between such a show, the lights are switched off and a torch is flashed in the dark(EVEREADYs tact). ITC's e-chaupal (chaupal is the common place where villagers gather) has been the most elaborate and extensive venture in this _eld so far.

However, they were wrong, soon they realized that to succeed in India they have to reach the nook and the corner of the country. They have to reach the \"local Paan wala, Local Baniya\" only they can succeed. MNC shoe giants, Adidas, Reebok, Nike started with exclusive stores but soon they realized that they do not enjoy much Brand Equity in India, and to capture the market share in India they have to go the local market shoe sellers. They have to reach to local cities with low priced products.\n" +

            "India is the youngest country in the world that means we have the highest number of youths as compared to the total population in the world and education is the most important phase of the youth. We are the fifth largest economy of the world but still, we are lacking in the world in terms of innovation and technology. Why are we behind those countries that are much smaller than us in terms of the economy? What are the reasons behind our failure? India is the same country where we had Taxshila and Nalanda University in the past where students from all over the world come here to study and our country give world leaders in the past but now our top universities including various Central Universities, IITs, NITs, and IIMs are not even in the top 500 Universities of the world. The main reason is the education system and the failure of our governments to provide assurance and facilities to our youths. The education environment of our schools and universities lacks enthusiasm and innovation. They are still following the same orthodox system for many decades that emphasize theoretical knowledge rather than practical knowledge. The curriculum of our education lacks co-curricular activities that help in improvising the overall personality of any student. Our students are becoming book worms which will increase their knowledge but they lack practical \n" +

                    "knowledge and it leads to a lack of qualities of leadership, innovation, and inventiveness. The condition of primary education in government schools is so \n" +
                    "severe that they do not have proper infrastructure. They do not have even basic facilities for toilets, classrooms, tables, and chairs. \n" +
                    "The other reason is the ease of availability of higher education to our youth. While governments of other developed countries are assuring to provide quality and cheap education to students, on the other hand, our governments are increasing the cost of education of government colleges and universities making it unapproachable for underprivileged students. The education budget of our country is much lower than in other developing or developed countries. Though education budget increases from 82,000 crores in 2014-15 to 99,300 crores in 2020-21 but budget for higher studies is however not sufficient to provide quality and cheap education to our students, it’s even below 1% of the total budget. The perfect example of the above case is the increment in the fee of M. Tech in IITs.\n" +
                    "The other reason is the shortage of teachers. India is short of teachers and skilled teachers are rarer to come by. As of now, the country has roughly 8.5 million teachers and only 19,000 teacher training institutes. This data shows how bad is the condition of our education system. \n" +
                    "Hence to progress in our country we need high-quality education that is cheap and easily approachable for all types of students. We need special schools and colleges that enhance the particular talent of the students for example singing schools, sports schools, designing schools and many more. Our central and states government should reform their educational policies and increase the allocation of budget for primary and higher education. The government should introduce the improvised curriculum to increase curiosity among the children and helps in grooming the overall personalities of students. When youths will get a high quality of education, they will be more productive and will contribute to building up of nation socially and economically.\n" +

            "With people all over the world having different opinions about feminism, it is very difficult for us to find out the true meaning that it once had. People in recent events have attached feminism with man-hating. Many argue that feminism now is different than the very idea that it was built upon, but what was the idea behind feminism? Well, feminism stands for the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. The first wave of feminism roots from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Women protested over 70 years to get equal rights, such as the right to vote and many other basic human rights. \n" +
                    "As the movement started to rise, it started involving various issues, from the right to vote to the reproductive rights. Women wanted to learn, grow and above all, to be considered as an individual. So how did the movement that started for the benefit of the women lead to such a place where many women across the world are hesitant before \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "relating to the word? To tell what exactly caused it would be impossible.The early third-wave activism tended to involve fighting against workplace sexual harassment and working to increase the number of women in positions of power. The third wave thought and worked in a different manner than the early ones, but they also lacked a strong cultural momentum-and understanding. There is no central goal, proper legislation or a social understanding of the word they associate with.\n" +
                    "Women, from different worlds have different meaning of feminism for them. For third world women it is basic human rights like education and the right over their own body, whereas for first world women it is equality in the society and a social standing similar to that of men, and rights over their own body, dismissing each other on the basis of the account of their different needs, feminists started to break as a group. \n" +
                    "It is no doubt that feminism is still relevant in the 21st century, with women around the world still struggling to get the basic rights that the first wave struggled to achieve is an indicator that feminism is still important. Feminism is yes, different now but as we all know that change is the only constant. In a world where toxic masculinity rules over men, everything a woman does is sexual, feminism is a fight, against everyone, either it be a man or a woman, to be, above all, considered as an individual.\n",

It's an interesting fact that one day humans can generate their own organs and give life. Recently it has been topic of advanced research that has evoked great expectations for the future. It helps us to understand how living things work and how they behave differently during any disease.\n" +
                    "   Scientists are working upon stem cells to find ways of using them in treating various diseases like Parkinson, Cancer, Arthritis, Organ failure, etc. Large quantities of cells, such as dopamine-secreting neurons for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and Insulin-Secreting pancreatic beta cells for the treatment of diabetes, could be produced from embryonic stem cells for cell transplantation. It is presumed that may be one day they can even replace skin of a person who is heavily injured or severely burnt. They are obtained from early-stage embryos — a group of cells that forms when a woman's egg is fertilized in an in-vitro fertilization clinic. Adult stem cells are not considered since they are easily affected by environment hazards and are not versatile. Some stem cells are already used in therapies like treatment of bone marrow cancer. The stem cells used in them were taken from umbilical cords of humans. Therefore, we can conclude that stem cells can play a great role of our lives and our next generation treatment can rely on stem cells.",

                    "A space elevator is a proposed type of planet-to-space transportation system. the main component would be a cable anchored to the surface and extending into space. A counterweight at the upper end keeps the centre of mass well above the geostationary orbit level. This produces enough upward centrifugal force from earth’s rotation to fully counter the downward gravity, keeping the cable upright and taut. The key concept of a tower reaching geosynchronous orbit was proposed by a Russian scientist in 1895 by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.\n" +

                    "We have everything to build an elevator, anchor, counterweight, elevator car but the tether is an extreme challenge. In September 2018, a researcher from Shizuoka University in Japan launched an experiment to the ISS to test practically one of the aspects of space elevator. It was far away from a fully-fledged space elevator but the goal was to show that locomotion along a cable in space is possible. For the tether of the elevator, at present, there is not any material strong and light enough that could be stretched to 100,000 kilometres in the space. The material has to be resistant to weather, radiation and orbital debris. Carbon nanotubes have been identified as possibly being able to meet the specific strength requirements for an Earth space elevator. Japanese scientists have been working on this and the construction firm Obayashi has announced their plans to build a space elevator by 2050. They are not only the one toying with the idea. China intends to build one by 2045 and NASA commissioned studies to look into how feasible the idea is.\n" +
                    "So why all this fuss about the space elevator! Just consider for a moment - What’s wrong with good old chemical powdered rockets? We already have rocket and shuttle technology to lift payloads and people to space but it is extremely costly. Building a space elevator would require billions of dollars but once it is built the launches into space would become economical. A space elevator would generate so many possibilities like building and launching spaceships into orbits. Scientists could make frequents trips to Moon, Mars or other planets for more explorations. Adventure Tourists can travel to space just to get there, walk a few thousand kilometres in space and get a selfie for a lifetime. And one can easily understand what it  is like up  there.\n",

Hence, according to the main server only one transaction was made between Danny and Rick giving them 2 and 4 Bitcoins respectively.

This left Julia into a dilemma that was she spiritually possessed or was she alright? Everything was normal till twilight approached. Julia was busy in tying her hair when she felt suffocated as if her throat was choked. She went in the bathroom to discover blood gushing out from her mouth as she vomited.
